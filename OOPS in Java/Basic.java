//OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING SYSTEMS JAVA .........

//Object - oriented programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes
// and objects.It simplifies the software development and maintence by providing some concepts
// defined below --.



//CLASS:: Class is a user -defined data type which defines its properties and its functions.
//Class is the only logical representation of the data.

//Example:: Human being is a class. The body parts of a human being are its properties , the
// actions performed by the body parts are known as functions.


//OBJECT:: Object is a run-time entity . It is an instance of the class. An object can represent
//a person, place or anyother item.An object can operate on both data members and member
// function.

//EXAMPLE ::

class basic{
    String color;
    public void printColor(){
        System.out.println("The color of this Pen is "+ this .color);
    }
}


// class OOPS{
   // public static void main (String args[]){
       // Pen p1=new Pen();
       // p1.color=blue;
       // Pen p2=new pen();
       // p2.color=black;
       // Pen p3=new Pen();
       // p3.color=red;
       // p1.printColor();
      //  p2.printColor();
    //    p3.printColor();
  //  }
//}
